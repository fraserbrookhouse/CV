## About Me

Prior to being a graduate from the Makers Software Development bootcamp, I was a primary school teacher in China.

I have spent the last five years living and working in China as a teacher. During that time I have been in charge of the education of hundreds of students, I have been a leader, mentor and friend. Everyday I met new challenges related to language, culture, and personalities. I feel that I rose to them all, and came out stronger for them.

Now it is time for a new chapter in my life, and while the location may be familiar, the challenge is new.

## Hobbies & Other Interests

- ‚å® **Tinkering:** I like to build systems to solve problems. In China there is no Netflix or anything similar for western movies and tv shows. So I built by own, using a Synology NAS for storage with 40TB of drives and an Intel NUC running docker images that would find, download and organise media totally automatically. I then could stream and consume that media using any device, anywhere in the country using plex. In fact it was such a stable system that I had a number of friends who were also using my service.
- üíª **Tech:** I love my gadgets, I have always been interested in the tech scene and what is coming down the pipeline.
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Traveling & Languages:** I love to travel, I grew up travelling, and have lived in England, Scotland, Wales, Hong Kong, Australia, Hungary and China. During my 5 years in China I honed my Mandarin language ability. I have good conversational Mandarin and hold an HSK3 certificate.
- üèãÔ∏è **Fitness:** Since the first lockdown I have really gotten into my fitness. I now swim and weight lift pretty much every day of the week and enjoy tracking my hardwork on my apple watch.
