## About Me

I am a Fullstack Software Engineer. I've just graduated from Makers Academy bootcamp and am looking for my first job in Tech.

Prior to **"The Great Calamity"** I was living in China and had been working there in Education since 2015. Even before the current situation I was preparing for a transition into tech however. I had started a part time online degree in computer science with the University of London which I was studying for after work and on weekends. The current situation just jump started the move.

I hope to continue with my degree once I have a job to shore up my computer science fundamentals.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|-|-|-|
| [Task Monster](https://github.com/fraserbrookhouse/task_monster) | Our Makers final project. A gamified task management app, inspired by Tamagotchi. Completing tasks grows and evolves your monster, failing to complete them shrinks and eventually kills it.  | React Native, React Native Game Engine, Matter.js, Expo, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, CSS, HTML |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/fraserbrookhouse/acebook-rails-quadropus) | During this group project, we were asked to create a Facebook clone. During this project we focused on agile working styles and how they fit into our teams as well as understanding how to build our first Ruby on Rails project. | Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, Travis CI, RSpec and Capybara |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/fraserbrookhouse/banktechtest) | This was a practice tech test during Week 10 of the Makers course where we had to create a virtual bank. <br> A key focus during this project was to work on my planning and documentation of the project. | Ruby, RSpec |

## Experience

### Suzhou Foreign Language School (2019 to 2020) - Suzhou, China 
#### *Primary Teacher*

I was a Grade 6 Primary homeroom teacher at this bilingual school. I was responsible for planning and delivering the English language curriculum for my class. I taught English, Maths, Science, and PE.

Every week I would deliver around 25 lessons, I would have a parents meeting every friday to go over any concerns the parents or myself had, and I would write biweekly report cards for the parents to keep them up to date with their child's progress.

My greatest achievement in this job was designing, administering and grading the end of year examinations to all grade 6 students. This was not only the final grade that these students would receive at this school, but it was also used to determine which students would be admitted into the very competitive middle school.

I was also involved in organising and running special events such as Sports Day, and a Christmas show.

### Suzhou Institute of Trade and Commerce (2017 to 2019) - Suzhou, China
#### *ESL Teacher*

In this position I was in charge of delivering English lessons to university students studying finance related subjects. Each year I taught around 200 students. I aside from being given a textbook, the lesson planning and curriculum was mostly left to me. I was also responsible for writing and administering their end of year exams.

I was also the teacher in charge of competition preparation. I chose and trained 4 students to take part in a province wide English speech competition over the course of several months. I then travelled with them to Nanjing to accompany with them while they took part. 3 out of 4 students placed high enough to be awarded prizes.

At this job I was also seconded to a major clothing design and manufacturing business to teach their designers and salespeople business english twice a week to improve their ability to communicate with their American clients.

### Jiaxing Nanhu International Experimental Primary School (2015 to 2017) - Jiaxing, China   
#### *Primary Teacher* 

My first teaching job. During my time here I taught students in Grade 2, 4, 5 and 6. I was an ESL teacher and taught a number of different classes, amounting to roughly 200 students each year. I was responsible for designing and delivering my own classes, and giving students end of unit tests 4 weeks to assess their progress.

I also taught extra VIP classes in the afternoons to top students in small classes with a maximum of 8 students. These classes were more free, and often included things like story writing, or putting on performances.

### Carers at Home (2015) - Bramley, UK
#### *Auditor*

I was responsible for auditing treatment sheets submitted by carers over a 3-year period which has not been correctly filed. I created a searchable excel spreadsheet in order to discover carers who were consistently committing errors either in their paperwork or in treatment to ensure they were retrained where possible in order to keep our patients safe.

### Merlin Entertainments (2014 season) - Staines, UK
#### *Ride Operator* 

Worked as a ride operator at Thorpe Park. I was fully responsible for the safe and timely operation of the theme park attraction I was assigned to each day. I had to memorise operation manuals, pass license exams, and pass top up training every month.

As I was the ride operator I was also responsible for managing the other staff that were assigned to my ride. It was also my responsibility to manage the customers who used my ride, and ensure they were following the rules and being safe.

### David Lloyd Leisure (2010-2011) - Woking, UK
#### *Lifeguard, Tennis Coach and Child Care worker*

During my time here I had many responsibilities, often at the same time. 

I was the sole lifeguard for the member only pool, which required me to ensure the pool was being used safely by guests, and render first aid when needed. I was also responsible for ensuring water quality and that the pool pump system was operating correctly.

I ran group tennis class for young children. This required me to design activities for the classes, checkout and set up equipment and manage both children and parents while the classes took place.

I was a Child care worker at this kids club. This was somewhere parent's could drop off their kids to be looked after while they went to the gym. I had to be very adaptable as this was available without booking, so I could have 1 child or 8 children at a time. I had to ensure that the activities ran smoothly and the children had a fun and safe time.

## Internships

### CLSA - Hong Kong   
#### *Financial Analyst* 

I worked as aMacro-economic researcher on the ASEAN desk.
Here I learned to quickly find and parse economic data from a wide variety of countries and industries to deliver to clients in an easy to understand and actionable format.

My big achievement in this role was a to create a research paper on the expected economic impact of the El Niño weather event.

### Heidrick and Struggles - Hong Kong   
#### *Talent Acquisition*

I learned how to search for and find potential applicants for upper management level positions in financial institutions. I presented these potential applicants with a short summary of their qualifications and work experience so they could be easily compared.

## Other Things of Interest

## Hobbies & Other Interests

- ⌨ **Tinkering:** I like to build systems to solve problems. In China there is no Netflix or anything similar for western movies and tv shows. So I built by own, using a Synology NAS for storage with 40TB of drives and an Intel NUC running docker images that would find, download and organise media totally automatically. I then could stream and consume that media using any device, anywhere in the country using Plex. In fact it was such a stable system that I had a number of friends who were also using my service.
- 💻 **Tech:** I love my gadgets, I have always been interested in the tech scene and what is coming down the pipeline.
- ✈️ **Traveling & Languages:** I love to travel, I grew up travelling, and have lived in England, Scotland, Wales, Hong Kong, Australia, Hungary and China. During my 5 years in China I honed my Mandarin language ability. I have good conversational Mandarin and hold an HSK3 certificate.
- 🏋️ **Fitness:** Since the first lockdown I have really gotten into my fitness. I now swim and weight lift pretty much every day of the week. I use an app called Fitbod to generate my weightlifting workouts and enjoy tracking my hard work on my apple watch.
