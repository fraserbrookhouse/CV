## Fraser Brookhouse

Full stack developer with proficiency in Ruby, and some understanding of Javascript and Python. I can create fully featured web applications.

I have experience in the workforce, as a teacher I was always working to deadlines, making sure classes were planned for the next day, exams both written and graded on time, and report cards were completed. From working in another country I have learned how to work well with other people even when we may not approach things in the same way. My ability to speak more than one language means that I can think laterally and solve problems faster when I get stuck.

I am looking for a full stack position where I have the opportunity to use my skills to make real change and improvement.

## Experience

**Suzhou Foreign Language School** (August 2019 to March 2020)  
Primary School Teacher

- I was a Primary School Teacher in a Bilingual School. I was responsible for the total English eduction of one class of 25 Chinese Grade 6 students including Maths, English(speaking, writing, and listening), Science and PE. I planned and made presentations for 4 to 5 classes per day, graded homework given nightly, wrote and graded end of unit and end of semester tests, as well as helping to write and grade the middle school entrance exams that my students would take. I learned to work to strict deadlines as part of a team.

**Suzhou Institute of Trade and Commerce** (August 2017 to June 2019)  
English Teacher

- Taught business English to 200 Chinese students majoring in Finance and Accounting. As 1 of only 2 foreign teachers I was left to my own devices, other than being given textbooks. So I had to design, plan, and teach 4 to 5 classes per day as well as write and grade speaking and listening tests without any support from management or coworkers. I learned to be very efficient with my time, to be self-sufficient with my work and how to command a room of up to 30 adult learners to ensure I had their attention whilst teaching.

**Jiaxing Internation Experimental School** (November 2015 to June 2017)  
English Teacher

- Taught spoken English to 3 classes of Grade 4, 5 and 6 Chinese Primary School Students. I had to prepare and teach 4 classes per day. Not only was this my first teaching job and first job in a non-English speaking country, but I also joined this school in the middle of a term after the previous teacher was let go. This meant I had to quickly learn on the job with no pre-term preparation in order to ensure that I was fulfilling my students educational needs. The fact that I was asked to sign a contract for a second year speaks to how well I rose to the challenge.

## Hobbies

In my spare time I love to stay fit, I try to get to the gym 5 times a week, and swim at least 3.

My most involved hobby is definitely technology. I like to learn new technologies and use them in interesting and useful. In my largest project to date I built a media server, using a Synology NAS for storage mounted on an Intel Nuc Micro PC running Ubuntu for the processor. This server stores around 30 terabytes of media including movies, tv shows, music and photos all of which can be stream anywhere int he world using Plex. It has a web portal running in a docker container accessible through a proxy that allows me to manage it from anywhere in the word. Just to get this project up and running I had to learn how to use both linux and docker and how to get NAS to be mounted with correct permissions to allow it to be accessible on another system. It was a very exciting project and I find I have the most fun when I have to fix something that has gone wrong with it, rather than actually using it to see any of the stored media!
