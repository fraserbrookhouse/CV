## About Me

I am a Fullstack Software Engineer. I've just graduated from Makers Academy bootcamp and am looking for my first job in Tech.

Prior to **the great calamity** I was living in China and had been working there in Education since 2015. Even before the current situation I was preparing for a transition into tech however. I had started a part time online degree in computer science with the University of London which I was studying for after work and on weekends. The current situation just jumpstarted the move.

I hope to continue with my degree once I have a job to shore up my computer science fundamentals.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|-|-|-|
| [Task Monster](https://github.com/fraserbrookhouse/task_monster) | Our Makers final project. A gamified task management app, inspired by Tamagotchi. Completing tasks grows and evolves your monster, failing to complete them shrinks and eventually kills it.  | React Native, React Native Game Engine, Matter.js, Expo, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, CSS, HTML |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/fraserbrookhouse/acebook-rails-quadropus) | During this group project, we were asked to create a Facebook clone. During this project we focused on agile working styles and how they fit into our teams as well as understanding how to build our first Ruby on Rails project. | Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, Travis CI, RSpec and Capybara |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/fraserbrookhouse/banktechtest) | This was a practice tech test during Week 10 of the Makers course where we had to create a virtual bank. <br> A key focus during this project was to work on my planning and documentation of the project. | Ruby, RSpec |

## Hobbies & Other Interests

- ‚å® **Tinkering:** I like to build systems to solve problems. In China there is no Netflix or anything similar for western movies and tv shows. So I built by own, using a Synology NAS for storage with 40TB of drives and an Intel NUC running docker images that would find, download and organise media totally automatically. I then could stream and consume that media using any device, anywhere in the country using plex. In fact it was such a stable system that I had a number of friends who were also using my service.
- üíª **Tech:** I love my gadgets, I have always been interested in the tech scene and what is coming down the pipeline.
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Traveling & Languages:** I love to travel, I grew up travelling, and have lived in England, Scotland, Wales, Hong Kong, Australia, Hungary and China. During my 5 years in China I honed my Mandarin language ability. I have good conversational Mandarin and hold an HSK3 certificate.
- üèãÔ∏è **Fitness:** Since the first lockdown I have really gotten into my fitness. I now swim and weight lift pretty much every day of the week and enjoy tracking my hardwork on my apple watch.
